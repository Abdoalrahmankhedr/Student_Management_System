# Student_Management_System HeadLine  
In this Project, you will design and implement a Student Management System (SMS) using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for the backend logic.  

The system helps manage student records efficiently by allowing the user to **Add**, **View**, **Update**, **Delete**, and **Search** students.  
All data is stored and loaded from files, ensuring that the information is saved even after closing the application.  

The project demonstrates the integration between **OOP concepts** such as *Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction* with GUI development using **Java Swing**.

# Student_Management_System Design  
This is the link of the Design We make on figma to simulate  
simulate the flow of the Pages and Navigations Throught it.  
üîó [Figma Design Link](https://www.figma.com/proto/EMGo3CR506DGSYpU3m9fhh/Untitled?node-id=2-16&t=OQAMvkcaZ3tCQSlC-1)

The Figma prototype visually represents how the user will navigate through the system ‚Äî including the **Login Page**, **Dashboard**, and pages for **Adding**, **Viewing**, **Updating**, and **Deleting** student records.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Main Features  
- Add new students with data validation.  
- View all students in a dynamic table.  
- Update existing student details.  
- Delete student records with confirmation dialogs.  
- Search students by **ID** or **Name**.  
- Save and load data from a **CSV file**.

## üß† Technologies & Concepts  
- **Java Swing** ‚Üí For building the graphical user interface.  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** ‚Üí To create a clean, modular, and reusable structure.  
- **File Handling** ‚Üí To store and retrieve student information.
